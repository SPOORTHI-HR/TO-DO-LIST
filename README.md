# How It Works
HTML: The HTML file sets up the structure of the to-do list, including an input field, a button, and an unordered list to display tasks.

CSS: The CSS file styles the to-do list, making it visually appealing with a clean and modern look.

JavaScript: The JavaScript file adds functionality to the to-do list:

Adding Tasks: When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the text from the input field is added as a new list item.

Removing Tasks: Each task has a "Remove" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
